Analyzes single-cell differentiation data. single-cell diffusion map aims to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. Diffusion map are appropriate for the dimension-reduction of single-cell qPCR and RNA-Seq cell differentiation data as they can handle high noise levels, sampling density heterogeneities, missing and uncertain values. As a result, they can organize single cells along the non-linear and complex branches of differentiation, maintain the global structure of the differentiation dynamics and detect rare populations.
