# Manifold Alignment

We have two slightly different versions of alignment approaches.
The input to represent the weight matrix for each domain can be given in two forms:
 1. a sparse matrix.
 2. an array modeling the k-nearest neighbor for each instance. The files for this are in Alignment/knn/.

## Folder: Alignment

### Affine Matching

 * AffineMatching.m

### Procrustes Alignment

 * Procrustes.m

### Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

 * CCATwo.m
 * CCAThree.m

### Feature-level Manifold Projections

 * wmapGeneralThree.m
 * wmapGeneralTwo.m

### Instance-level Manifold Projections

 * wmapGeneralThreeInstance.m
 * wmapGeneralTwoInstance.m

### Unsupervised Alignment

The code is the same as feature-level manifold projections.
The only difference is how to create the correspondence matrix.

 * generateWeight3.m, used to generate weight matrix, calls:
   * computeOptimalMatch.m
   * decompose3.m 

## Folder: Utility

 * cmpEmbedding.m - compares different embedding results. Examples are represented as columns.
 * knnsearch.m - k-nearest neighbor search
 * LaplacianEigenmaps.m
 * LPP.m - Locality Preserving Projections
 * Showtopics.m
 * createAllConnectedGraph.m
 * createKnnGraph.m
 * L2_distance.m - All pairs Euclidean distance
