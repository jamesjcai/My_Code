PCA is map the data to lower dimensional. In order for PCA to do that it should calculate and rank the importance of features/dimensions. There are 2 ways to do so.

using eigenvalue and eigenvector in covariance matrix to calculate and rank the importance of features
using SVD on covariance matrix to calculate and rank the importance of the features SVD (covariance matrix) = [U S V']
